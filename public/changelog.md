# Rockford Update, Part A

**ðŸ”§ Changes**  

* Updated IRFD to new layout including runway, significant terrain, cities, island outline and waypoints  
* Changed runways on the radar to be grey lines, as this is the norm in other radar views

**Updates for Mellor and AB Garry can be expected over the course of the evening.**  

Happy Controlling and good luck with parallel approaches
