# Networking Fix + Compatibility Notice

**ðŸ”§ Website**  

* The warning "Firefox is NOT compatible with this website at all at all" now actually works. (Don't use Firefox, it will cause you to not be able to use the suite 80% of the time)

**ðŸ§° Internal**

* Fixed API server erroring after the Database had huge troubles adapting to a network configuration change (The cable moved one port to the right ðŸ¤¡)
* Fixed API server trying to analyze unrelated errors when users try to authenticate without Database connection

Happy Controlling
