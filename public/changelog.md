# Full On Success

So in case you haven't realised, for the ATC24 24h Around The Clock event the Event ATCs used the ATC24 Suite!  
I was controlling Perth for 2 hours as well lol don't even ask how that happened  
Overall great success, got a load of feedback from the Event ATCs and we can expect a ton of bug fixes when I get the time to.  
  
Now here are the changes coming with this changelog:

**üîß Changes**  

* Arriving flights SHOULD now display the arrival runway in the strip
* Callsigns are now ACTUALLY parsed properly

**üñ•Ô∏è Internal Changes**  

* Added additional checks to the API Server because *certain people* crashed it during the Event once. 


Happy Controlling
