# CTR Support

**ðŸ”§ Additions**  

* If you have automatic flight imports enabled and are controlling a CTR station (make sure you have selected the station type in the top left),  
  flights with routes including a waypoint in your airspace will now be imported and displayed with `[ENROUTE]` at the beginning of the route  

* Added waypoints to the Saint BarthÃ©lemy Radar  


Happy Controlling
