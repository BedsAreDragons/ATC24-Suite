Fertig zu machen:
- Discord Flugpläne automatisch importieren nach login

ZU FIXEN (Von MJ)
Flight strips clipping in APP/DEP column.
The text beneath the callsign box should display callsign, not airline name, e.g. "speedbird"
There's no CTR option on the station display.
No options for multiple RWYs.
The help section needs expanding:
  - Tad unclear of that the copy+paste needs to be done in the notes box, took me a bit to work out.
  - Add in that W and S move strips around.

Additional:
I also have a few suggestions that you can have a think about:

Once the user has copy and pasted the flight plan data into the notes, it auto deletes the text there to leave a blank box. Or if a route has been filed, placing the whole route into the box.
The aircraft box, could it have some string handling to search for common types ("A330","A340" etc.). As there's a bit of an issue with that box always being overflowing as loads of people write out long aircraft types.
Similar system for callsigns, where possible automatically changing text callsigns into their ICAO codes.
W and S being available to move strips up and down in column.
Ability to customise column names and/or add and remove columns.
Having the "status" box be able to flick through (PUSH/TAXI etc.), maybe using Q and E
IF POSSIBLE, being able to move strips around using mouse.

- "User Route" Box verstecken, wenn GPS gefiled
- "Paste Flightplan" Box verstecken, wenn Flugplan gepasted aber "Generate IFR Clearance" Einstellung disabled

Zukünftig:
- SHared Rooms
- Departure Wegpunkte auf Radar
- Ein-/Ausschaltbare Wegpunkte auf Radar

Möglich:
- Liste von In/Out Flügen in der Ecke vom Radar

<!-- -== ATC24 Ticket Message ==-
Hello there, good day.
I've developed a very handy program called ["ATC24-Suite"](https://zedruc.net/atc24-suite), which is now in public beta, allowing controllers on the network to have an all-in-one tool to control traffic on ATC24, which I wanted to show to you as I hope we could work together on enhancing the program and adding it to the software list in <#1107345207529328641>.
An insight on the development roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/Zedruc/ATC24-Suite-Feedback?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap).
As you can see, there are features that would require working together with ATC24 developers to enable me to realise them (Items M5 and M6), and I'm really hoping that such a project would be possible! -->
