<b><u>ðŸ§° Hotfixes</u></b

<b>*</b> Fixed an issue where the client was stuck in a room after server reloads.<br />
<b>*</b> Fixed internal handling of room IDs to better handle situations of server/client
desyncs.<br />
<br />
Note: If you create a room after this server reload, the strips you already have will
automatically<br />
be added to that room and you can continue normally.<br /><br />
Happy Controlling, and apologies for the resets!<br />
