<h3 style="margin: 0" id="changelog">No More Cluttering and ATIS Gen Updates</h3>
<br />
<b><u>ðŸŒ  Additions</u></b
><br />
<b>*</b> Added Credit to the ATIS Generator as I had unknowingly used Data from Fromic. All good we
chill<br />
<b>*</b> Added an Arrival List. Enable "Hold Arrivals in Arrival List"<br />
so arrivals are held in the list until you click on them to accept them.<br /><br />
<b><u>ðŸ”§ Fixes</u></b
><br />
<b>*</b> Fixed IFR clearances not being generated<br />
<b>*</b> Strips now fill in the active runway automatically<br />
<b>*</b> VFR flights are now actually displayed as VFR, not as IFR Outbound<br />
<b>*</b> Made the size of the "Connected - X Member(s)" text dependent on screen width so no text
wrapping occures
<br />
<br />
Happy Controlling<br />
